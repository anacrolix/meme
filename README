# About

meme is a minimal scheme. It's implemented in C, has GC, and should express reasonable TCO. Run the examples like so:

    $ ./meme fact.w
    5040


# Special forms

 (^ args... body)
    Captures the environment when invoked. Parameters are bound to the name of each `arg` in the evaluation of the `body` if called.
 (- a b...)
    The integers of `b` are each subtracted from the value of `a`.

# TODO

 * Decide on the "nil" type. Void, empty, (), and others are all very similar.
